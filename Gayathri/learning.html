          <h2>My Learning </h2>
        
		<div>
          <br>
		  <h4><b><u>Academics</u></b></h4><br>
		  <h5>
			I always aimed to be a topper in my studies. Whether it's my school or my college, 
			I aimed to gain my knowledge through understanding and be a topper.<br>
			<br>
			
			I got 92% in my grade 10, 86% in my grade 12 and 89% in my Bachelors degree until semester 6. I am proud to be a consistent CSE Department topper throughout my semesters.<br><br>
			Yeah! Many say that numbers doesn't matter. But it matters to me always. I believe that always helped me to be confident and add a value to myself. <BR><BR>
			
			</h5><br>        
      </div>
	  
	  <div>
          <br>
		  <h4><b><u>Online Learning</u></b></h4><br>
		  <h5>
			I love learning through online. I always try to upgrade myself with extra learning on the subjects on which I have interest.<br>
			<br>
			
			I have done and been doing a lot of online courses and certifications to develop and add value to myself.<br><br>
			My interested areas are Python, Machine learning, Deep learning, Data science, Web development and Personal development. 
			And I always takeup great courses on those topics.<BR><BR>
			My favourite websites are Coursera, Udacity, Hackerrank, Udemy and many more. Whenever someone reccommend
			a new course from a new platform, I love to try it.<br><br>
			
			</h5><br>        
      </div>
	  <div>
          <br>
		  <h4><b><u>My Projects</u></b></h4><br>
		  <h5>
			<u>Facial Expression Recognition</u> is one of my favorite projects of mine. Tensorflow is what facinated me to do the same.
			<br>TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. It has a comprehensive, flexible ecosystem of tools, 
			libraries and community resources that lets easily build and deploy ML powered applications.<br>
			
			To run the application, it needs high speed internet and computer. And when my expression could be identified by my machine,
			I felt really happy.<br><br>
			<u>Shopping site using Django</u> is an another static web page creation which helped me understand the frontend part of creating a website.<br>
			It's a static page which displays the products and it's description for the customers.<br><br>
			<u>Music Preference Application</u> is the one which I tried during my learning of Machine learning. It's a basic ML project. <br>
			Assuming that there is a music player app, we predict the type of music preferred by various age groups of people using this application.
			<br><br>
			<u>My Resume Website</u> is my simple web page development project where I learnt about using javascript and bootstrap. And 
			yeah! the website which you are reading right now is what I am saying about. I update and develop this frequently.
			</h5><br>

          <br>
		  <h4><b><u>Hobby Based Learning</u></b></h4><br>
		  <h5>
			I identified my hobby of writing later in the lockdown which happened due to Covid-19 pandemic. Yes. I didn't know my talent till then.<br>
			<br>
			I write blog. It's a positive one with an aim to spread positivity. Along with that I write quotes and diary. Writing helped my get 
			clear understanding of myself and helps me take decisions.<br><br>
			Along with that I wanted to takeup something new in writing. So did a Content Writer internship at Learnweel. I got an experience of working
			at home and as a professional. It helped me learn 
			new things, new ideas, new words and learn the language and vocabulary really well.<BR><BR>
			Along with that, I write valuable Linkedin Posts frequently.<br><br>
			This is all about my writing. I always develop my writing along with my learning such that 
			it travels with me along throughout my life.
